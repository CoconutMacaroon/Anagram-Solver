# Anagram-Solver
This is an anagram solver. It takes an anagram and solves the anagram.  

It takes an input via the `input()` function, and then loops though a dictionary file looking for matches.  
Note that `main.py` references a dictionary file (`dictionary.txt`), but that is not in this repository. When `main.py` is run, a dictionary file named `dictionary.txt` will need to be in the same directory as `main.py`.
