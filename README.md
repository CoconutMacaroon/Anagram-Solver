# Anagram Solver
<img alt="GitHub Workflow Status" src="https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/coconutmacaroon/Anagram-Solver/PyTest">

I am working on the code, but the README might not be up to date. To run the tests, run `pytest` with Python 3. GitHub also will automatically run PyTest on every commit/PR made. This project uses tests to reduce errors, so please remember to add tests for new features. Contributions are welcome, from a quick change, to a major feature. Thanks!
